# infra-ansible
A proof of concept for Ansible at the Apache Software Foundation

## To Do:

* Hetzner needs an API key for the hetzner script to work
    * Once that's done we can extract names from the output and do the name based sorting.

* Leaseweb can use cloudmonkey(?) to list the instances in our private cloud.
